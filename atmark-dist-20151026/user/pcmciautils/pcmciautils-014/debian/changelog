pcmciautils (014-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Honour PCMCIA=no (or false) in /etc/default/pcmciautils (closes:
    https://launchpad.net/bugs/52231).
  * Fall back to /usr/lib/pcmciautils/config.opts if /etc/pcmcia/config.opts
    doesn't exist (closes: #392222).

pcmciautils (014-2) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Depend on lsb-base (>= 3.0-6).

  [ Scott James Remnant ]
  * Remove stop links from rc0 and rc6.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Fri, 21 Jul 2006 11:23:36 +0100

pcmciautils (014-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Don't mention persistent udev mappings in README.Debian, they are
    taken care of automatically nowadays.
  * Updated Standards-Version to 3.7.2.
  * Removed /usr/share/doc/cardmgr-to-pcmciautils.txt.gz because it
    doesn't really apply much to Debian.

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@debian.org>  Thu, 22 Jun 2006 15:22:44 +0200

pcmciautils (013-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Use ENV{MODALIAS} instead of MODALIAS in udev rules, since the latter is
    deprecated.
  * Move init script to /etc/init.d/pcmciautils in the udeb, so that
    pcmciautils-udeb and pcmcia-cs-udeb don't have to contain the same file
    (and thus break if pcmcia-cs-udeb accidentally gets unpacked into a 2.6
    installer). Requires hw-detect 1.36.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Wed,  7 Jun 2006 01:46:04 +0100

pcmciautils (013-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Use new sysfs pm_state interface instead of power/state which will
      (likely) go away.
    - Add 'pccardctl ls' (or 'lspcmcia') to provide extended debugging
      output.
  * Fix unintentional fallthrough to insert from pccardctl ls.

pcmciautils (012-5) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Improve efficiency of udev rules by checking at the top for ACTION="add"
    and otherwise jumping to the end. Requires udev 064 (closes: #350381).
  
  [ Per Olofsson ]
  * Rebuild against libsysfs2. Closes: #355535.

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@debian.org>  Mon,  6 Mar 2006 15:05:08 +0100

pcmciautils (012-4) unstable; urgency=low

  [ Colin Watson ]
  * Remove unnecessary ancient-shell paranoia from init script (#350381).
  
  [ Per Olofsson ]
  * Install a special config.opts on some archs.
  * Remove /etc/pcmcia/config.opts when purging. This file has been taken
    over from pcmcia-cs now.
  * Also remove /etc/pcmcia/ if empty.
  * Put config.opts in /usr/lib/pcmciautils instead of
    /usr/share/pcmciautils since it's different on different
    architectures.
  * Simplify the init script and make it print less confusing messages.
    Closes: #351545.
  * Build with V=true to get verbose output from the build process.
  * Document the allow-hotplug /etc/network/interfaces option in
    README.Debian. Closes: #352038.
  * Add debian/watch.

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@debian.org>  Sat, 18 Feb 2006 23:10:39 +0100

pcmciautils (012-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Don't depend on udev, only recommend it. This makes it possible for
    pcmcia-cs to depend on pcmciautils without requiring people to install
    udev. This makes upgrades smooth. udev also isn't strictly required,
    it's possible to use pcmciautils without it depending on the
    circumstances. Closes: #350182.
  * Added note about udev to the description also.

 -- Per Olofsson <pelle@debian.org>  Sat, 28 Jan 2006 13:58:27 +0100

pcmciautils (012-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Make init script exit immediately if pcmciautils has been removed but
    not purged (closes: #348749).
  * Create udev rules symlink on initial install too (closes: #345795).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sun, 22 Jan 2006 21:57:54 +0000

pcmciautils (012-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
    - Incorporates our config.opts fixes, and some config.opts changes from
      OpenSuSE.
    - Avoids deprecated libsysfs functions for compatibility with libsysfs2.
    - Implements 'pccardctl status'.
  * Build-depend on debhelper 4.2 for udeb support.
  * Merge from Ubuntu:
    - Use 'modprobe -b' from module-init-tools 3.2.2 so that PCMCIA bridges
      can be blacklisted.
    - Use 'modprobe -b' to load pcmcia and pcmcia_core.
  * Fix udev rules symlink (thanks, Tobias Gruetzmacher; closes: #343193).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Sat, 24 Dec 2005 11:10:54 +0000

pcmciautils (011-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Use upstream's man page rather than our own.
  * Ship new upstream documentation.
  * Update FSF address in debian/copyright.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Tue,  6 Dec 2005 11:01:13 +0000

pcmciautils (010-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial upload to Debian (closes: #319583).
  * Add Per Olofsson as uploader.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@debian.org>  Mon,  5 Dec 2005 21:24:31 +0000

pcmciautils (010-0ubuntu6) dapper; urgency=low

  * Ship /etc/pcmcia; the postinst needs it.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Fri, 25 Nov 2005 12:14:12 +0000

pcmciautils (010-0ubuntu5) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add an init script (mostly borrowed from pcmcia-cs) to probe old ISA
    bridges. Copy /etc/default/pcmcia to /etc/default/pcmciautils on new
    installs or upgrades from earlier versions to make sure that this
    doesn't stop working when pcmcia-cs is purged.
  * Add init script to the udeb too, as /etc/init.d/pcmcia; this conflicts
    with pcmcia-cs-udeb but that's OK and it's what hw-detect expects.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Thu, 24 Nov 2005 16:43:45 +0000

pcmciautils (010-0ubuntu4) dapper; urgency=low

  * For now, back out GOTO/LABEL changes that unnecessarily require new
    udev.
  * Instead, add explicit ACTION=="add" to pcmcia_socket rules.
  * Add a man page for pccardctl, derived from cardctl(8).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 22 Nov 2005 17:00:48 +0000

pcmciautils (010-0ubuntu3) dapper; urgency=low

  * Simplify config.opts to make it easier for d-i to modify.
  * Remove 0x800-0x8ff range - it seems to cause problems on many machines
    (Matthew Garrett).
  * Exclude 0xcf8-0xcff too to work better on Sony Vaios (Tollef Fog Heen,
    https://bugzilla.ubuntu.com/show_bug.cgi?id=8677).

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 22 Nov 2005 16:21:56 +0000

pcmciautils (010-0ubuntu2) dapper; urgency=low

  * Add a pcmciautils-udeb package for use in the installer.
  * Fix various bugs in udev rules, thanks to Scott James Remnant:
    - Remove redundant and non-functional modalias rule.
    - Use MODALIAS="?*" rather than MODALIAS="*", since the latter matches
      every event.
    - Match SUBSYSTEM rather than setting it.
    - $DEVPATH should be $devpath.
    - Bracket the whole file with an ACTION!="add" check (two of the rules
      were missing ACTION=="add"). Requires udev 064.
  * Import packaging into bzr; add note to debian/copyright with location.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Tue, 22 Nov 2005 16:12:36 +0000

pcmciautils (010-0ubuntu1) dapper; urgency=low

  * Initial release, configured only with udev support.
  * Move udev rules to position 85.
  * Move udev helpers to /lib/udev.

 -- Colin Watson <cjwatson@ubuntu.com>  Mon, 21 Nov 2005 08:42:49 +0000
