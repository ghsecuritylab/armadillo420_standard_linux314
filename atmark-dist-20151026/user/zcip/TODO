It'd be cool if it didnt need libnet and libpcap. Might be possible to
incorporate it into normal linux net-tools, which has its own lib support.


Make sure all ARP packets are broadcast, not unicast.


verify standards compliance


atexit bring down the interface


Add autoconf. Maybe work around no packet filtering? Don't link everything
statically.


Look at portability issues (for when we don't have glibc support, such
as in embedded applications).


Add support for ipaliasing. Ideally we'd check if the interface was
already configured UP, and if so, use the next alias (so if eth0 is up,
we use eth0:0, then eth0:1 and so on up to eth0:255). Maybe trash existing
configurations if some option was specified.


Maybe add an option to put a link-local on all interfaces that are
present? (SIOGIFCONF ioctl can help) Or if we had the ipaliaising
stuff, we could make this the default, and use the -i option for doing
individual interfaces.


interoperates poorly with the incorrect zeroconf implementation in W2K
build 2195

    W2K skips the detection phase and goes straight to the claim phase.
    It's initial ARP requests have the sender IP set to the machine's
    desired IP address.
