This is hermit-at, a fork of hermit[1] version 1.3.

Hermit-At is a boot loader/downloader combination for embedded
software development.  It inherits the ability to support multiple
targets with a common infrastructure from the orignal hermit.  It
currently supports the following boards:

  - Armadillo series
  - SUZAKU series

Because Hermit-At is a derived work of Hermit 1.3, which is
distributed under the GNU General Public License version 2, Hermit-At
is also available under the same license.  Please see COPYING for more
details.

We, the maintainers of hermit-at, consider forks in the general open
source community as not being the best solution.  We are happy to
provide patch sets to merge this Hermit-At code base back to the
original Hermit.

We hope you will find this program useful. Happy Hacking!
