-- Hermit doesn't support fast serial downloads.  It should switch to
   115200 bps for serial downloads, and should support data compression.

-- Hermit doesn't yet handle Ethernet retransmits correctly, so it's
   best to use it with a dedicated NIC and either a crossover cable or
   dedicated hub.

-- The CRC32 table is duplicated between the kernel decompression code
   and the download integrity checking code.

-- Hermit should skip past locked flash blocks at the beginning of a
   region (bumping the download after them) instead of erroring out.
   This is probably what most people want.

-- Some people have experienced problems with EDB7211 downloads using
   10/100Mbit Ethernet switches, but found old 10Mbit hubs to work fine.
   This may be because the MAC address change confuses the switch.  At
   Blue Mug, we have been using crossover Ethernet cables to good effect.
