	* Hermit version 1.3.

	* New, cleaner Makefile system which supports a single
	TARGET/PROFILE combination at a time.  The system will complain if
	you don't properly clean the tree between different targets or
	profiles.
	
	* EP7211: Added gzip-decompressed splash screen support based on a
	splash screen patch from JonM.  Cleaned up the standard gunzip
	code to support this.  Added a progress meter on the LCD which
	tracks the progress of the kernel unzip (one bar for every gunzip
	window flush; the window size is currently 32K).

	* EP7211: Added a 'edb7211-kernel' profile for Hermit testing and
	infrequently-used, one-off commands.  This profile runs from DRAM
	like the boot mode profile, but doesn't expect a memory
	remapping.  Download it to 0xc0028000, then start it from the
	flash Hermit using the 'linux' command.
	
	* EP7211: N.B.: The 'linux' command now just boots the kernel
	without unzipping it.  Use the 'unzip' command to unzip the
	kernel first.

	* Some contributions from Michael Kropfberger
	<michael.kropfberger@liscon.com> and Gerhard Schaden
	<ges@liscon.com>: addition of 16-bit peek and poke; added support
	for devices without a keyboard.

	* JonM has changed the default Linux root device to flash.  The
	exact device is the ROM/flash card major (major 31), minor 17
	(second flash bank).

	* Hermit version 1.2.

	* EP7211: Switched serial UART from UART1 to UART2; initialize
	both in startup code.  This frees up UART1 (which has modem
	control lines) for other stuff, like running a serial mouse.

	* Hermit version 1.1.

	* Fix a typo (words swapped) in the manpage; add some
	documentation about how to pick an Ethernet address.
	
	* Use -M instead of -MM in dependency generation script to pick up
	cases where we include files with <> instead of "".

	* EP7211: Added support for gzipped kernel images (using the
	gunzip code from the Linux kernel).  This replaces the old,
	non-zipped kernel support, so you have to use compressed images
	now.  The rationales are that:
	- flash is expensive,
	- downloads take time,
	- decompression is fast,
	- you can detect the end of a zipped image, and
	- I want to keep the boot loader small and option-free.

	* EP7211: Inclusion of 'life' is now optional, and disabled by
	default (use LIFE=y).  The gunzip code is a little bloated, and I
	was getting nervous that a crash was caused by a stack overflow
	(turns out was just a bug).
	
	* EP7211: Update documentation to reflect the fact that kernels
	should now be gzipped (Image.gz, not zImage).
	
	* EP7211: Run CPU at 74MHz.  This speeds up booting (especially
	with decompression); it also seems to speed up Ethernet downloads.

	* EP7211: Add a bunch of useful notes to the EP7211 documentation.

	* Initial Hermit release (version 1.0).
