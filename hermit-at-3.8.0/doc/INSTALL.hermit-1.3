The target-side Hermit boot loader requires a GCC toolchain for the
target for which you are building (e.g. `arm-linux-gcc' and related
tools).

For now, there's no way of selecting a target to build, since there
is only one target.  Just type 'make' in the Hermit root directory;
this will build both host and target sides.

'make install' installs Hermit to /usr/local, unless you override
INSTALLPREFIX on the command line.
