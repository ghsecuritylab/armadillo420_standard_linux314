config IMX_WEIM
	bool "Freescale EIM DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_MXC
	help
	  Driver for i.MX WEIM controller.
	  The WEIM(Wireless External Interface Module) works like a bus.
	  You can attach many different devices on it, such as NOR, onenand.

config MVEBU_MBUS
	bool
	depends on PLAT_ORION
	help
	  Driver needed for the MBus configuration on Marvell EBU SoCs
	  (Kirkwood, Dove, Orion5x, MV78XX0 and Armada 370/XP).

config OMAP_OCP2SCP
	tristate "OMAP OCP2SCP DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS
	help
	  Driver to enable ocp2scp module which transforms ocp interface
	  protocol to scp protocol. In OMAP4, USB PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP and in OMAP5, both USB PHY and SATA PHY is connected via
	  OCP2SCP.

config OMAP_INTERCONNECT
	tristate "OMAP INTERCONNECT DRIVER"
	depends on ARCH_OMAP2PLUS

	help
	  Driver to enable OMAP interconnect error handling driver.

config SIMPLE_PM_BUS
	bool "Simple Power-Managed Bus Driver"
	depends on OF && PM
	depends on ARCH_SHMOBILE || COMPILE_TEST
	help
	  Driver for transparent busses that don't need a real driver, but
	  where the bus controller is part of a PM domain, or under the control
	  of a functional clock, and thus relies on runtime PM for managing
	  this PM domain and/or clock.
	  An example of such a bus controller is the Renesas Bus State
	  Controller (BSC, sometimes called "LBSC within Bus Bridge", or
	  "External Bus Interface") as found on several Renesas ARM SoCs.

config ARM_CCI
	bool "ARM CCI driver support"
	depends on ARM
	help
	  Driver supporting the CCI cache coherent interconnect for ARM
	  platforms.
